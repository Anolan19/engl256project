<h1> A corpse of a hero of old</h1>

"I laid low the warriors of old and their like is not in the world today. Then I was but young and tender. Now I am old and strong, strong, strong"
The ancient heroes are the only ones that are the only ones who could even possibly stop me now. Too bad that they are all dead now.

        <ul><li> Truly inspiring that you have slain your enemies so. I must ask, how many other dragons have you et, and are these the Yarges I have heard so much about? </li></ul>
    </li>
    <li> <h3>Smaug</h3>
        <ul><li> Eat... another dragon? No, I can not say that I have. Dragons are quite rare here in my corner of the world. I have eaten the heroes of the race of men from the lands of Dale, when they tried to stop me, before they knew better. I can not say that I am familiar with the term Yarg </li></ul>

        <ul><li> Ah, eating the heroes, that sounds like the way to go. Do you have a favourite recipe? I just quite enjoy a good midnight snack. </li></ul>
    </li>
    <li> <h3>Smaug</h3>
        <ul><li> I like to burn them with my dragonfire first, then just gobble them up whole. </li></ul>
    </li>
    <li> <h3>Daverak</h3>
        <ul><li> That makes sense. Dragonfire is something a little bit more rare for dragons to have here, tough</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li> <h3>Bilbo</h3>
        <ul><li> Smaug, is that the case here? Do you have to rest between bursts, or something?</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li> <h3>Smaug</h3>
    <ul><li> YOU DARE TO QUESTION MY POWER? I WILL DESTROY YOU LIKE I HAVE DONE TO COUNTLESS OTHERS BEFORE.</li></ul>
</li>
    <li> <h3>Prunella</h3>
        <ul><li> Why did you post this so many times?</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li> <h3>Smaug</h3>
        <ul><li> BECAUSE I HAVE KILLED THIS MANY SO CALLED HEROES THAT HAVE DARED TO DEFY ME. I AM DEATH. I AM FIRE. I SHALL NOT BE STOPPED BY SOME WEAK NEW HERO</li></ul>
