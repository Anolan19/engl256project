    Not seen in the picture: the cup is engraved with birds and jewels. It's kinda big, I don't know how those puny small people were able to use it, but too bad, it's mine now. The bottom says that it belongs to a Thror, which is a stupid name

    <li> <h3>NothinButNet (Balin)</h3>
        <ul><li> Yes, it is beyond value both in terms of being a priceless artifact and it is a sentimental item for the race of dwarves. </li></ul>

    <li> <h3>SMAUG</h3>
        <ul><li> Neat. YOU WILL NOT HAVE IT BACK, MORTAL. IT IS MINE, AND YOU CAN NOT TAKE IT. </li></ul>
