        <ul><li>@YouAreMe I like it. Old dwarven artifacts from past ages are priceless relics that should be preserved at all costs. </li></ul>

    <li> <h3>YouAreMe (Essun)</h3>
        <ul><li>I think we will have to disagree here. It is just some deadciv relic, there are so, so many of them, and none are really special.</li></ul>
