    <h1>Smaug's Blaug</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my blog, mortal. My name is Smaug </p>

    <p>Meet Smaug, my Lonely Mountain locked Dragon. Since 150 years ago, I've been living strictly in the Lonley Mountain. I'm an Dragon, which means I can't use banks and I can't trade with the races of men, dwarves and elves. This is my story. I'm going to be taking on one of Middle Earth's smallest challenges: Dwarves coming to reclaim their ancestral homeland.<em>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs-w7E2HZWwXmjt9RTvBB_A">source</a>)</em></p>
    <p>Once I have claimed the Lonely mountain for my own, I have settled down. I have a nice pile of gold to sleep upon, and plenty of treasures to hoard. I have killed all of my enemies, so I have nothing to worry about any longer. You can read about my accomplishments here, or learn more about me.</p>
